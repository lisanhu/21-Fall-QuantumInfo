So far, information is a function of probabilities.

Today:
* QM is about more than probabilities

Wave-Particle duality
* True for any quantum 'particle'

We shall stick to light 

---

__Light is a wave__
* moving periodic disturbance
* obeys the principle of superposition

If $\Phi_1$ is a light wave of amplitude $I_1$

and $\Phi_2$ is also a wave with amplitute $I_2$

Then $\Phi_1 + \Phi_2$ is also a light wave.

$\Phi_1$ and $\Phi_2$ can be complex numbers

$\Phi_1 = |\Phi_1|e^{i\cdot \varphi_1}$

Energy in the light field $E\varpropto |\Phi|^2$

__Light is (also) a particle__
* energy of light is carried in discrete packets/quanta
    + 1 quanta of light is called a photon
    + 1 photon of light frequency $f$ has energy $E=h\times f$
        + plank's constant $\approx 6.6\times 10^{-34} J \cdot s$

__Aside:__
1 laser pointer ~ 1mW power
- = $1\times10^{-3}J$ of energy per second
- Optical freq ~ $10^{14}$ Hz
- => 1 optical photon has energy $h\times 10^{14} \approx 10^{-20}J$
- => laser pointer $\approx$ stream of $10^{17}$ photons
- => a wave description is sufficient

For 2 waves of amplitutdes
- $\Phi_1 = \sqrt{I_1}e^{i\cdot \varphi_1}$
- $\Phi_2 = \sqrt{I_2}e^{i\cdot \varphi_2}$

Total intensity 
- $I = |\Phi_1 + \Phi_2 |^2 = |\Phi_1|^2 + |\Phi_2|^2 + \Phi_1^*\Phi_2 + \Phi_1\Phi_2^*$

Review:	
- $\Phi_1 = a+i\cdot b$
- $\Phi_1^* = a-i\cdot b$
- Also, $\Phi_1 = \sqrt{I_1}e^{i\cdot \varphi_1 }$, then $\Phi_1^*=\sqrt{I_1}e^{-i\cdot \varphi_1}$
- $e^{i\cdot \theta} = cos\theta + i\cdot sin\theta$
- energy of a wave of amplitutde $\Phi$ is $E \varpropto |\Phi|^2$
- $\Phi_1 = a + i\cdot b = \sqrt{I_1}e^{i\cdot \varphi_1} = \sqrt{I_1}(cos\theta + i\cdot sin\theta)$
- Real part $\Rightarrow a = \sqrt{I_1}cos\theta$
- imaginary part $\Rightarrow b = \sqrt{I_1}sin\theta$
- $I = I_1 + I_2 + 2\sqrt{I_1I_2}cos(\varphi_2 - \varphi_1)$

How to explain interferences of light photon by photon?

---

For a single photon,
- $\Phi\equiv$ probability amplitude
    - a mathematical construct which cannot be compared to anything measurable

But, the probability of finding a photon at x, $prob(x) = |\Phi|^2$

Recall, for waves, $Energy \varpropto |\Phi|^2$
- for photons, $Energy = h\cdot f \times$ (Prob. you have a photon in that place)
- $\therefore Energy \varpropto |\Phi|^2$

With just 1 slit open,
- Prob. for finding a photon at x $= P_1(x) = |\Phi|^2$

With the 2nd slit open,
- Prob. for finding a photon at $x = P_2(x) = |\Phi_2|^2$
- with both slits open, $P = |\Phi_1 + \Phi_2|^2 = P1 + P2 + ()\cdot cos(\varphi_1 - \varphi_2) \neq P1 + P2$

Very different from classical prob theory scenarios

---

__Eg. coin toss__

Flip 2 coins 
- Prob. of both heads = P1, 
- tails = P2
- Prob. that both coins landed on same side $= P1 + P2$

__observation:__ Only tiny things behave quantum mechanically
				(photons, atoms, electrons, , ... )
Big things don't 

___NOT TRUE!___

--- 

__Which way' experiment__

(double slit exp with photon detectors on the slits figure) shows no interference

Suppose you put tiny detectors at both slits,

$\Rightarrow$ you know which slit each photon went through

Then the prob. to see photon at point $x = P1 + P2$  no interference term!

---

The essential difference between 2 coins (adding prob.) and 2 slits (adding prob. amplitudes) is all about information

Quantum rules for adding probability and amplitudes (vs. classical world's adding probabilites) 
- ONLY apply when the system is informationally isolated.
- if scramble again then the interference come back

informationally isolated $\Rightarrow$ produces no record anywhere in the universe

Weirdness of Quantum theory is bacause this probabilistic behavior is inherent/fundamental 

It allows for mutually exclusive situations to exist simutaneously in a "quantum superposition"
